## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In this homework, we write a program to simulate the Schelling  Model. 

The Following are some basic rules that this program built with:

1. The world is a 50 $\times$ 50 grid, for a total of G = 2500 cells.
2. The agents are always 50% X and 50% O. In the visualization program, blue grid represent X and red grid represent O. In the case that world contains agent with different satisfaction threshold, the deeper color grid represent the higher threshold one.
3. The Satisfaction Threshold is measured by the number of same type agents in neighbor of 8.
4. If an agent is unsatisfied, it will try to find a empty space that make him happy, using 8-distance to find the closest cell. It will move to the empty space if it can find one, if not, it will stay at its place this iteration.
5. The agent will be allowed to go back to its previous place.
6. When agent is checking if an empty space is satisfied, if neighbor of 8 of the empty space contains the agent itself, it does not count as a similar agent.
7. Agents are updated according to the cell they occupy, left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Start at the top-left corner in the grid, move left-to-right along the first row, and update all the agents you encounter. Once done with the row, move down to the leftmost cell of the second row, and repeat the above steps.
8. All the agent move at the same time in one iteration.
